====

(https://travis-ci.com/SeatownAC/05-linked-lists.svg?branch=master)



## Requirements  
#### Configuration  
  <!-- list of files, configurations, tools, etc that are required -->
  Your lab directory must include  
  * **index.js** -- The entry point to your module
  * **README.md** -- with a documentation about your lab
  * **.gitignore** -- with a robust .gitignore
  * **.eslintrc** -- with the class .eslintrc file
  * **.eslintignore** -- with the class .eslintignore
  * **.travis.yml** -- travis-ci instructions
  * **.package.json** -- with all dependencies and dev-dependencies
  * **lib/** -- directory for holding your programs helper modules
  * **__tests__/** -- directory for holding your programs unit and integration tests




#### Feature Tasks  
* implement a Singly Linked List (SLL) data structure
* implement `append(value)`, `prepend(value)`, `reverse()`, and `remove(offset)` methods to the SLL class
* implement `serialize()` and `deserialize()` methods on the class
	* To `serialize` means to convert an object to string form.
	* To `deserialize` means to take the serialized string and convert to an object.
	* Think JSON.stringify and JSON.parse but write your own instead! NOTE: JSON.parse wouldn't work as is anyway, why would that be?
* in a comment within each function, note the it's Big-O runtime

#### Rubric:
  * Tests: 2pts
  * Passes linter: 1pts
  * Completed Data Structure: 5pts
  * Big-O notation: 2pt
